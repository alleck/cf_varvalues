# CF_VarValues #
################

A simple script that you can include on any of your ColdFusion scripts to see what veriables are set, and what their values are.

***DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK WITH SQL VARIABLES***

To use: Place the <code>VarValues.cfm</code> file in the directory with the sripts you are wanting to test. Once in place, simple include the file with <code>&lt;cfinclude template="VarValues.cfm" /&gt;</code> at the end of the page.
